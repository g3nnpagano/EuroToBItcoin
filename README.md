# EuroToBitcoin
My project was developed as part of my Javascript course at start2impact. This project features a counter where the amount in euros is displayed on the left, and its equivalent in Bitcoin is shown on the right. There are several intuitive buttons that allow you to increase the euro amount and see its value in Bitcoin. At the bottom of the page, there is the updated value of Bitcoin every 60 seconds.
